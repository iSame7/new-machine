- I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) instead of the Stock terminal Mac app
- I use [oh-my-zshell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- I use [Solarized Dark](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for the terminal colors
- I use [powerline-shell](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell) to get those cool path bars. I usually hide the host name and the user, before running `python ./setup.py install`, edit the config file and comment out `username`, `hostname`
- I use the [Meslo Powerline Font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/Meslo%20Slashed/Meslo%20LG%20M%20Regular%20for%20Powerline.ttf) as you need a font that supports the directory characters for `powerline`
