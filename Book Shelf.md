This is the list of books in my library that I read or partially read. Not sorted in any order. **The ones in bold mean I highly recommend.**

## Technical

### Interview Prep

- [ ] [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/)

If there is extra time:
- [ ] [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836)
    - all code is in C++, very good if you're looking to use C++ in your interview
    - a good book on problem solving in general.

### Computer Architecture

If short on time:

- [ ] [Write Great Code: Volume 1: Understanding the Machine](https://www.amazon.com/Write-Great-Code-Understanding-Machine/dp/1593270038)
    - The book was published in 2004, and is somewhat outdated, but it's a terrific resource for understanding a computer in brief.
    - The author invented HLA, so take mentions and examples in HLA with a grain of salt. Not widely used, but decent examples of what assembly looks like.
    - These chapters are worth the read to give you a nice foundation:
        - Chapter 2 - Numeric Representation
        - Chapter 3 - Binary Arithmetic and Bit Operations
        - Chapter 4 - Floating-Point Representation
        - Chapter 5 - Character Representation
        - Chapter 6 - Memory Organization and Access
        - Chapter 7 - Composite Data Types and Memory Objects
        - Chapter 9 - CPU Architecture
        - Chapter 10 - Instruction Set Architecture
        - Chapter 11 - Memory Architecture and Organization

If there is more time (I want this book):

- [ ] [Computer Architecture, Fifth Edition: A Quantitative Approach](https://www.amazon.com/dp/012383872X/)
    - For a richer, more up-to-date (2011), but longer treatment

### Code Refactor
- [ ] [Working Effectively with Legacy Code (Robert C. Martin)](https://www.amazon.de/dp/0131177052)

### TDD 
- [ ] [Growing object oriented software guided tests](https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627)

### Programming languages
#### Swift 
- [ ] [Swift the language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)
- [ ] [Modern AutoLayout by Keith Harrison] 
- [ ] [Swift unit testing by Jon Reid](https://pragprog.com/book/jrlegios/ios-unit-testing-by-example)
- [ ] [App Architecture](https://www.objc.io/books/app-architecture/)
